# Temperature-Prediction-Using-Various-Regression-Models
This project aims to predict annual temperatures between two industries using historical data. The dataset includes temperature records from the "GCAG" and "GISTEMP" sources over several decades. The goal is to predict temperatures for the years 2016 and 2017 using various regression techniques and evaluate their performance.
